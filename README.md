# Codelab for learning about changes to background location gathering in Android "O".

Apps running on "O" devices have significant limits placed on background
location gathering. These limits apply regardless of the `targetSdkVersion`
specified in `build.gradle`. This codelab shows how to work with these new
limits.

Just transferred googles example to kotlin and updated the gradle and google play services version. 
There were a few changes.
